# üîê Login Issue Fixed!

## Issue
The login form was requiring passwords to be at least 6 characters, but your admin password "admin" is only 5 characters.

## Solution Applied
‚úÖ Updated `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` to accept any password length (minimum 1 character)

The login form now only checks that a password is provided, and Django backend will validate the actual credentials.

## Why This Works
- **Login**: Backend (Django) validates actual credentials, so frontend doesn't need strict validation
- **Signup**: Still requires 6+ characters for NEW passwords (good security practice)

## You Can Now Login!

1. Start both servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # Terminal 2
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit: http://localhost:3000

3. Click "Login"

4. Enter:
   - **Email**: admin@gmail.com
   - **Password**: admin

5. Click "Sign In"

‚úÖ **It will work now!**

## Alternative: Change Your Password (Optional)

If you want a more secure password, you can change it:

```bash
python manage.py changepassword admin
```

Then use the new 6+ character password.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Ready to login!
