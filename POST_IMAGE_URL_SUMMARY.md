# Image Upload/URL Feature - Summary

## What Changed

### 1. Frontend Updates (`CreatePostModal.tsx`)

**New State Variables:**
- `imageUrl`: Stores the URL input value
- `imageInputType`: Tracks whether user selected "file" or "url" mode

**New UI Components:**
- **Toggle Buttons**: Two-button interface to switch between upload modes
  - "Upload File" button
  - "Image URL" button
- **URL Input Section**: Appears when "Image URL" is selected
  - Text input for pasting URLs
  - Live preview of URL image
  - Clear button to reset

**Updated Logic:**
- `handleImageUrlChange()`: Handles URL input and sets preview
- Updated validation: Accepts either file OR URL (not both)
- Updated form reset: Clears both file and URL states
- Updated submission: Sends `image_url` to backend when URL is provided

### 2. Backend Updates (`api_views.py`)

**New Imports:**
```python
import requests
from django.core.files.base import ContentFile
from urllib.parse import urlparse
import os
```

**New Method:**
- `MarketplacePostListCreateView.create()`: Overridden to handle image URLs
  - Downloads image from provided URL
  - Validates HTTP response
  - Extracts filename from URL or generates one
  - Saves downloaded content to ImageField
  - Returns appropriate error messages on failure

### 3. Documentation
- Created `IMAGE_URL_FEATURE.md` with comprehensive guide

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd c:\Users\NidaUllah\OneDrive - Higher Education Commission\Documents\Development\fb_marketplace_bot
   python manage.py runserver
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test File Upload:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/posts
   - Click "Create Post"
   - Keep "Upload File" mode selected
   - Upload a local image file
   - Fill other fields and submit

3. **Test Image URL:**
   - Click "Create Post" again
   - Click "Image URL" button
   - Paste a URL like: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505740420928-5e560c06d30e?w=800`
   - Verify preview appears
   - Fill other fields and submit

4. **Test Validation:**
   - Try submitting without image (should show error)
   - Try switching between modes (should clear previous selection)
   - Try invalid URL (should show error on preview)
