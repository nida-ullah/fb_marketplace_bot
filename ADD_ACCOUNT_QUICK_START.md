## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Make sure both servers are running:

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd c:\Users\NidaUllah\OneDrive - Higher Education Commission\Documents\Development\fb_marketplace_bot
python manage.py runserver
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd c:\Users\NidaUllah\OneDrive - Higher Education Commission\Documents\Development\fb_marketplace_bot\frontend

```

### 2. Test the feature:

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard/accounts**
2. Click the blue **"Add Account"** button (top right)
3. Fill in the modal:
   - **Email**: Your Facebook email
   - **Password**: Your Facebook password
4. Click **"Add Account"**
5. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - Modal shows "Adding..." with spinner
   - Browser window opens automatically
   - Facebook login page loads with auto-filled credentials
   - Three possible outcomes:
     - ✅ **Success**: Login works, session saves, modal closes
     - 🔒 **CAPTCHA**: Solve it manually (you have 90 seconds)
     - ❌ **Error**: Wrong credentials, error message shown
6. After successful login:
   - Modal shows "Account Created!" (green)
   - Automatically closes after 2 seconds
   - Accounts list refreshes

👉 Please solve it manually in the browser...
⏳ Waiting 90 seconds for you to complete...

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Browser Window**: Don't close it manually! Let the automation complete.
2. **CAPTCHA**: If CAPTCHA appears, solve it within 90 seconds.
3. **2FA**: If your Facebook has 2FA enabled, complete it manually.
4. **Session Files**: Created in `sessions/` folder with format: `email_domain_com.json`
5. **Session Status**: Refreshes when you reload the Accounts page.

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **It's Working If**:
- Modal opens when clicking "Add Account"
- Browser window opens automatically
- Email/password are auto-filled
- Session file is created in `sessions/` folder
- Account appears in the list
- Status badge shows "Active" (green) after login

❌ **Something's Wrong If**:
- Modal doesn't open → Check console errors
- Browser doesn't open → Check backend terminal for Playwright errors
- Login fails → Check credentials
- Session not saved → Check `sessions/` folder permissions
- Account not showing → Refresh the page

---

## 🚨 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Browser doesn't open
**Fix**: Install Playwright
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Problem: "Account already exists"
**Fix**: Email is already in database. Delete it first or use different email.

### Problem: CAPTCHA timeout
**Fix**: Edit `automation/post_to_facebook.py` line ~60:
```python
time.sleep(90)  # Change to 180 for more time
```

### Problem: Session not saving
**Fix**: 
1. Check browser completes login
2. Verify `sessions/` folder exists
3. Check Django logs for errors
