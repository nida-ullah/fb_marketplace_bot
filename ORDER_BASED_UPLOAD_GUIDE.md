## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use File Explorer's Detail View
1. Open your images folder in File Explorer
2. Switch to "Details" view
3. Sort by "Date taken" or "Date modified"
4. Select images in order from top to bottom

### Tip 2: Name Files with Numbers (Optional but Helpful)
If you want to make it easier, you can still rename:
```
1_iphone.jpg
2_tv.jpg
3_laptop.jpg
```
Then they'll always be in the right order!

### Tip 3: Preview Before Upload
- After selecting images, the modal shows how many you selected
- You can see the filenames listed
- If wrong order, just re-select!

### Tip 4: Don't Need Images for All Products?
No problem! Just upload fewer images than CSV rows.
- 5 CSV rows + 3 images = First 3 products get images, last 2 don't

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Selection Order Matters!
- The order you CLICK images = the order they're uploaded
- Not alphabetical, not by date, but by CLICK ORDER
- Use Ctrl+Click to select multiple in specific order

### How to Select in Order:
```
‚úÖ CORRECT:
Click ‚Üí Ctrl+Click ‚Üí Ctrl+Click (in the order you want)

‚ùå WRONG:
Ctrl+A (selects all, but order is unpredictable)
```

### Best Practice:
1. Sort your images folder by name (1_xxx, 2_xxx, etc.)
2. Then Ctrl+A to select all
3. Files will be in alphabetical order

## üîß Technical Details

### How Order Matching Works:

Backend code:
```python
# Images matched by INDEX (position), not filename
for row_index, row in enumerate(csv_reader):
    if row_index < len(image_files):
        image_file = image_files[row_index]  # Get image at same index
```

Frontend code:
```typescript
// Files are sent in the order they were selected
imageFiles.forEach(file => formData.append("images", file));
```

### Why This is Better:
- ‚úÖ No manual filename matching
- ‚úÖ No renaming required
- ‚úÖ Simpler CSV format
- ‚úÖ Fewer steps
- ‚úÖ Less error-prone
- ‚úÖ Works with any filename

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What if I select images in wrong order?**  
A: Just close the file dialog and select again. Or reorder CSV rows to match images.

**Q: Can I still use the old filename matching?**  
A: No, the app now uses order-based matching exclusively. It's much simpler!

**Q: What if I have more images than CSV rows?**  
A: Extra images are ignored. Only the first N images (matching CSV row count) are used.

**Q: What if I have fewer images than CSV rows?**  
A: That's fine! Products without images will be created without images.

**Q: How do I know the selection order?**  
A: After selecting, the modal shows filenames in the order they'll be used.

**Q: Can I drag and drop instead of clicking?**  
A: The file dialog depends on your OS, but Ctrl+Click is the most reliable method.
