## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why TXT instead of CSV?**
A: TXT is simpler! No column headers, no escaping commas, easier to read and write.

**Q: What if my description has multiple lines?**
A: Keep it on one line in the TXT file. Use spaces or periods instead of line breaks.

**Q: Do I need to name images specifically?**
A: No! Just select them in the same order as your products. The app matches by position.

**Q: Can I still use URL for single posts?**
A: No, URL option is removed. Upload images directly (safer and simpler).

**Q: What if I forget the blank line?**
A: The parser might get confused. Always put a blank line after each product's price!

**Q: Can prices have decimals?**
A: Yes! Use `699.99` or just `699` - both work.
