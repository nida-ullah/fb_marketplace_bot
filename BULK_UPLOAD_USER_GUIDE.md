## üîß Detailed Instructions

### Step 1: Download Sample CSV

Click the **"Sample CSV"** button in the interface to download a pre-formatted template with example data.

**What you get:**
- Properly formatted CSV with correct column headers
- 3 sample products with real image URLs
- Ready to edit and customize

### Step 2: Prepare Your CSV File

#### Using Excel:
1. Open the downloaded sample CSV in Excel
2. Keep the first row (headers) unchanged
3. Replace sample data with your products
4. Save as **CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)**

#### Using Google Sheets:
1. Upload the sample CSV to Google Sheets
2. Edit your product data
3. Download as **CSV (.csv)**

#### Important CSV Rules:
- ‚úÖ Keep column headers exactly as: `title,description,price,image_url`
- ‚úÖ Use plain text (no special formatting)
- ‚úÖ Enclose text with commas in quotes (e.g., "Camera, Lens, Bag")
- ‚úÖ Price must be numbers only (e.g., 99.99, not $99.99)
- ‚ùå Don't use formulas
- ‚ùå Don't add extra columns

### Step 3: Add Product Images

You have **two options** for images:

#### Option A: Use Image URLs (Recommended for Bulk Upload)
```csv
title,description,price,image_url
Product Name,Description here,99.99,https://example.com/image.jpg
```

**Where to get image URLs:**
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com (free high-quality images)
- **Pexels**: https://pexels.com (free stock photos)
- **Your website**: Upload to your server and use the URL
- **Image hosting**: Imgur, Cloudinary, etc.

**Getting URL from Unsplash:**
1. Find an image on unsplash.com
2. Click "Download" ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "Copy image address"
3. Add `?w=800` to the end for optimal size
4. Paste into your CSV

#### Option B: Leave Image URL Empty
```csv
title,description,price,image_url
Product Name,Description here,99.99,
```
Posts will be created without images (you can add them later).

### Step 4: Select Facebook Accounts

**Single Account:**
- Check one account checkbox
- All CSV posts will be created for this account

**Multiple Accounts:**
- Check multiple account checkboxes
- Each CSV post will be duplicated for ALL selected accounts
- Example: 5 CSV rows √ó 3 accounts = 15 total posts

**Select All:**
- Click "Select All" button
- All accounts will be checked at once

**Account Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Active** (Green badge): Account has active session, ready to post
- ‚ùå **No Session** (Red badge): Account needs login (posts created but won't auto-post)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### CSV Preparation
1. **Test with small file first** - Upload 2-3 products before full batch
2. **Verify image URLs** - Open URLs in browser to ensure they work
3. **Use consistent pricing** - Same currency and decimal places
4. **Keep descriptions concise** - Facebook has character limits
5. **Proofread carefully** - Errors multiply across accounts

### Image URLs
1. **Use reliable sources** - Unsplash, Pexels, or your own server
2. **Optimize image size** - Add `?w=800` to Unsplash URLs
3. **Test accessibility** - Ensure URLs work in incognito/private mode
4. **Use HTTPS** - Secure URLs (https://) are preferred
5. **Avoid redirects** - Direct image URLs work best

### Account Management
1. **Check session status** - Ensure accounts have active sessions
2. **Don't overload** - Don't create hundreds of posts at once
3. **Stagger uploads** - Space out large batches to avoid flags
4. **Monitor results** - Check that posts are created correctly
5. **Update sessions** - Refresh sessions before large uploads

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "CSV file could not be parsed"
- **Cause:** Invalid CSV format
- **Fix:** Ensure file is saved as CSV, not Excel (.xlsx)
- **Check:** Open in text editor, should see comma-separated values

### "Failed to download image from URL"
- **Cause:** Image URL is inaccessible or incorrect
- **Fix:** 
  - Test URL in browser
  - Ensure URL is public (not behind login)
  - Use direct image URLs, not webpage URLs

### "Invalid price"
- **Cause:** Price contains non-numeric characters
- **Fix:** Remove $, commas, or text from price column
- **Correct:** `99.99`
- **Incorrect:** `$99.99`, `99.99 USD`, `Ninety-nine`

### "Missing required fields"
- **Cause:** Empty cells in required columns
- **Fix:** Ensure every row has title, description, and price
- **Note:** image_url can be empty

### Posts created but not posting
- **Cause:** Account has "No Session" status
- **Fix:** 
  1. Go to Accounts page
  2. Click "Update Session" for the account
  3. Complete Facebook login
  4. Posts will auto-post after session is active

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Large Uploads (100+ rows)

1. **Split into batches**
   - Upload 50-100 rows at a time
   - Wait for completion before next batch

2. **Use image URLs**
   - Faster than uploading files
   - Less bandwidth usage

3. **Pre-verify data**
   - Check all URLs work before upload
   - Validate prices and formatting
   - Remove duplicate rows

4. **Monitor server load**
   - Don't upload during peak hours
   - Allow time between large batches

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All CSV files are processed server-side
- Image URLs are downloaded and stored on your server
- Original URLs are not stored
- Files are not cached or logged
- HTTPS recommended for all image URLs

## üì± Mobile Support

The bulk upload page is **not optimized** for mobile devices. For best experience:
