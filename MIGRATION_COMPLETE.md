# Database Migration Complete ‚úÖ

## Migration Summary

Successfully migrated data from old database to new database while preserving the approval system and password encryption.

## What Was Migrated

### Facebook Accounts: 4/4 ‚úÖ
- **nidaullah2002@gmail.com** (Old ID: 2 ‚Üí New ID: 2)
- **posttomarketplace3@gmail.com** (Old ID: 3 ‚Üí New ID: 3)
- **posttomarketplace2@gmail.com** (Old ID: 7 ‚Üí New ID: 4)
- **shamsullahn2999@gmail.com** (Old ID: 20 ‚Üí New ID: 5)

All passwords have been encrypted using Fernet encryption.

### Marketplace Posts: 7 unique posts ‚úÖ
All posts belonged to account ID 7 (posttomarketplace2@gmail.com):
1. testing the post
2. iPhone 13 Pro
3. Samsung 55 inch TV
4. Gaming Laptop
5. Shoes Skect
6. shoes
7. car

**Note**: Old database had 19 posts, but 12 were duplicates (same title + same account) and were correctly skipped.

### Session Files Available
The following session files are present in the `/sessions/` folder:
- nidaullah2002_gmail_com.json
- posttomarketplace2_gmail_com.json
- posttomarketplace3_gmail_com.json
- shamsullahn2999_gmail_com.json

## Database Status

### Old Database (Backed up)
- **File**: `db.sqlite3.backup_before_approval_system`
- **Size**: 204K
- **Users**: 5
- **Facebook Accounts**: 4
- **Posts**: 19 (with duplicates)

### New Database (Current)
- **File**: `db.sqlite3`
- **Size**: 192K
- **Users**: 3 (admin + 2 test users)
- **Facebook Accounts**: 5 (1 test + 4 migrated)
- **Posts**: 7 (unique)

## New Features Preserved

### 1. User Approval System
- New users must be manually approved by admin
- Users see "Account pending approval" message until approved
- Admin can approve/reject users from admin panel

### 2. Password Encryption
- All Facebook account passwords are encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption
- Old plain text passwords were migrated and encrypted
- Uses `set_password()` to encrypt and `get_password()` to decrypt

### 3. User Isolation
- Each user can only see their own accounts and posts
- Superusers can see all data

## Migration Scripts

### `migrate_script.py`
Migrated Facebook accounts from old database with password encryption.

### `migrate_posts_standalone.py`
Migrated marketplace posts with account ID mapping and duplicate detection.

## Schema Differences Handled

The old database was missing some fields in MarketplacePost:
- `category` (required in new schema)
- `condition` (required in new schema)
- `location` (optional in new schema)

Migration script only copied fields that existed in both schemas:
- title, description, price, image, status, posted
- scheduled_time, created_at, updated_at
- error_message, retry_count (if present)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Migration complete
2. üîú Test posting functionality with migrated accounts
3. üîú Verify session files work correctly
4. üîú Test end-to-end flow: Create post ‚Üí Schedule ‚Üí Post to Facebook

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Old database backup**: Always kept at `db.sqlite3.backup_before_approval_system`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Session files**: Not migrated (already in correct location)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Admin account**: The admin user from the new database is still active:
- Username: admin
- You may need to reset password if needed

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test users**: Two test users were created during approval system testing. You can delete them if not needed.
