Perfect! Yes, as the site owner/admin, you can see all users and their data!

What You Can See as Site Owner:
Current Statistics:

Total Users: 5 registered users
Admin Account: You (4 Facebook accounts, 19 posts)
Regular Users: 4 test users (all with 0 accounts/posts)
Platform Total: 4 Facebook accounts, 19 posts
How to Access This Information:
1. Django Admin Panel (Easiest Way)
You already have access to the Django admin panel at:

Login with your superuser credentials (admin/admin), and you can:

View all registered users
See each user's Facebook accounts
Browse all marketplace posts
Edit or delete any data
See detailed statistics
2. Custom Admin Dashboard (Recommended for Production)
You can create a special admin-only page in your frontend that shows:

Total registered users
Platform-wide statistics
Individual user statistics
Growth metrics over time
Would you like me to:

Create an admin dashboard API endpoint that only superusers can access?
Create a frontend admin page to visualize these statistics?
Show you how to use the existing Django admin panel for user management?
The important thing is: Regular users are completely isolated (they only see their own data), but you as the admin/superuser can see everything for platform monitoring and management! ðŸŽ¯
