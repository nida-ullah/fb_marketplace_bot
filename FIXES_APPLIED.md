# Fixes Applied to post_to_facebook.py

## Issue
The "Condition: New" selection was being skipped during the Facebook Marketplace posting process.

## Root Cause
The dropdown menus (Category, Condition, Availability) were not given enough time to fully open and render their options before attempting to click on them. The script was only waiting 1 second, which wasn't sufficient.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Improved Condition Selection** (Line ~147-201)
- ✅ Increased wait time from 1 second to 2 seconds after clicking dropdown
- ✅ Added multiple fallback approaches to find and click "New":
  - **Approach 1**: Try role-based selection (`get_by_role("option", name="New")`)
  - **Approach 2**: Try text locator with exact match
  - **Approach 3**: Use keyboard navigation (Home → ArrowDown → Enter)
- ✅ Added detailed console logging for each attempt
- ✅ Script continues even if condition selection fails (graceful degradation)

### 2. **Improved Category Selection** (Line ~104-147)
- ✅ Increased wait time to 2 seconds
- ✅ Added role-based selection as primary method
- ✅ Added text locator as fallback
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

### 3. **Improved Availability Selection** (Line ~225-259)
- ✅ Increased wait time to 2 seconds
- ✅ Added role-based selection for "In stock"
- ✅ Added keyboard navigation fallback
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

## Key Improvements

1. **Longer Wait Times**: Changed from 1000ms to 2000ms to allow dropdowns to fully render
2. **Multiple Fallback Methods**: Each selection now tries 2-3 different approaches
3. **Better Logging**: Clear console messages showing which method succeeded
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Script continues even if some fields fail to populate
5. **More Specific Selectors**: Using `get_by_role("option")` for better reliability

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the command: `python manage.py post_to_marketplace`
2. Watch the console output for messages like:
   - ✅ Clicked on Condition dropdown
   - ✅ Selected Condition: New (via role/text/keyboard)
3. If you see "❌ Could not select New condition", check the screenshot at `error_screenshot.png`

## Notes

- The script now waits **2 seconds** after clicking each dropdown (Category, Condition, Availability)
- Multiple selection strategies increase success rate
- Facebook's UI may change, so multiple approaches provide resilience
- All console output uses emojis for easy visual parsing
