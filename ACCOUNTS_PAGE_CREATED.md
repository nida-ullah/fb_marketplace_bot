## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Visit the page**: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/accounts

2. **What you'll see**:
   - Stats cards showing account summary
   - Table with all your Facebook accounts
   - Session status for each account
   - Delete button (with confirmation)

---

## 📊 What the Page Shows

Based on your admin panel (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/accounts/facebookaccount/`), the page will display:

- **Total Accounts**: Number of Facebook accounts in database
- **Active Sessions**: Accounts that have a session JSON file in `/sessions/` folder
- **No Session**: Accounts without session files
- **Account Details**: Email, session status, creation date

---

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- ✅ **Card** - For stats and table container
- ✅ **Button** - For actions (Add, Delete)
- ✅ **Icons** - Users, CheckCircle, XCircle, Trash2, Plus
- ✅ **Table** - Responsive accounts list
- ✅ **Status Badges** - Green (Active) / Red (No Session)

---

## 🔗 API Integration

The page uses:
- `GET /api/accounts/` - Fetch all accounts
- `DELETE /api/accounts/<id>/` - Delete an account

Backend response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "account@example.com",
    "session_exists": true,
    "created_at": "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## ✨ Next Steps

The page is fully functional! You can now:

1. ✅ **View all accounts** - See your Facebook accounts
2. ✅ **Check session status** - Know which accounts need login
3. ✅ **Delete accounts** - Remove accounts with confirmation
4. ⏳ **Add accounts** - Button ready (needs form implementation)

---

## 🛠️ To Add "Add Account" Feature

To make the "Add Account" button work, you'll need to create a modal or separate page with a form that:
1. Accepts email and password
2. Calls `POST /api/accounts/` with the data
3. Refreshes the accounts list

Would you like me to add this feature now?
