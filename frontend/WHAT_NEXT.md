## 🚀 Option 1: Test the Frontend NOW (Recommended)

### Step 1: Start the Dev Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Browser
Visit: http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Explore
- **Landing Page** `/` - See the design
- **Login Page** `/login` - Try the form (won't work without backend)

rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use
