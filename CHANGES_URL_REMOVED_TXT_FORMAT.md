### 2. ✅ Changed Bulk Upload from CSV to TXT Format

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/components/BulkUploadPostsModal.tsx`
- `postings/bulk_upload_with_images.py`

#### Frontend Changes:

**State & Functions:**
- `csvFile` → `txtFile`
- `setCsvFile` → `setTxtFile`
- `downloadSampleCSV` → `downloadSampleTXT`
- File accept changed: `.csv` → `.txt`
- Input ID changed: `csv-upload` → `txt-upload`

**UI Text Updates:**
- Modal title: "Create Multiple Posts via CSV" → "Create Multiple Posts via TXT File"
- File label: "CSV File" → "TXT File"
- Button text: "Upload CSV" → "Upload TXT"
- Instructions updated to explain TXT format
- Sample download changed to TXT format

**New TXT Format:**
```
Title of Product 1
Description of product 1
Price 1

Title of Product 2
Description of product 2
Price 2
```

Each product has:
- Line 1: Title
- Line 2: Description
- Line 3: Price
- Line 4: Blank line (separator)

#### Backend Changes:

**File:** `postings/bulk_upload_with_images.py`

**Major Changes:**
- Removed `csv` import (no longer needed)
- Changed parameter: `csv_file` → `txt_file`
- Completely rewrote parsing logic:
  - Old: CSV DictReader with columns
  - New: Line-by-line parsing (3 lines per product + blank line)
- Updated error messages to reference TXT instead of CSV
- Maintains order-based image matching (1st image → 1st product, etc.)

**Parsing Logic:**
```python
# Parse TXT file - each product has 3 lines + blank line
while i < len(lines):
    title = lines[i].strip()
    description = lines[i + 1].strip()
    price_str = lines[i + 2].strip()
    # Validate and create post
    i += 4  # Move to next product
```
