# üéâ COMPLETE SOLUTION - Production-Ready Bot

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed!

### 1. ‚úÖ Path Issue Fixed
**Problem**: `manage.py` not found  
**Solution**: Fixed path calculation from 3 levels to 2 levels  
**File**: `postings/api_views.py`

### 2. ‚úÖ Headless Mode Implemented
**Problem**: Browser opens on production server  
**Solution**: Environment-based headless configuration  
**Files**: `bot_core/settings.py`, `automation/post_to_facebook.py`, `postings/api_views.py`

### 3. ‚úÖ Production Ready
**Result**: Bot now works both locally AND on hosted servers!

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Local Testing (See Browser)
```bash
# Set environment for visible browser
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false

# Or create .env file
echo "PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false" > .env

# Start server
python manage.py runserver

# Test posting - browser will open!
```

### For Production (Headless)
```bash
# Install Playwright
pip install -r requirement.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m playwright install-deps  # Linux only

# Set environment for headless
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true

# Run server
python manage.py runserver
# or
gunicorn bot_core.wsgi:application

# Browser runs in background!
```

## üìä What You Get

| Mode | Browser | Console | Best For |

## üéØ How It Works

### Environment Variable
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false  # Development (see browser)
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true   # Production (headless)
```

- Create `.env` file: `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false`

**Production Hosting**:
- **Heroku**: `heroku config:set PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true`
- **AWS/EC2**: `export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true`
- **Render**: Add in Environment Variables section

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Local Development**: Always use visible mode (`PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false`)
2. **Debugging**: Check both Django console AND `logs/posting_process.log`
3. **Production**: Always use headless mode (`PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true`)
4. **Testing**: Test locally with visible mode before deploying
5. **Logs**: Monitor `logs/posting_process.log` for real-time output
6. **Git**: Never commit `.env` file (already in `.gitignore`)
