### 3. **Image Optimization**

- **Grid View**: 160px height (saves ~20% space)
- Next.js Image component with proper `sizes` attribute for optimization

### 4. **Visual Improvements**

## 🎨 UI Components

### List View Layout
```
[Checkbox] [80x80 Image] | Title | Status Badge | Price | Account | Date | [Edit] [Delete]
```
- Compact horizontal rows
- Truncated text with ellipsis
- All info visible without scrolling
- Perfect for browsing many posts

### Grid View Layout
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ [Checkbox]      │
│   [Image 160px] │
├─────────────────┤
│ Title + Badge   │
│ Description     │
│ $Price          │
│ Account         │
│ Date            │
│ [Edit] [Delete] │
└─────────────────┘
```
- Visual card-based layout
- Better for image-focused browsing
- Checkbox overlay on top-left

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<"list" | "grid">("list");
const [selectedPosts, setSelectedPosts] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false);
```

### Key Functions

#### Bulk Delete
```typescript
const handleBulkDelete = async () => {
  setIsDeleting(true);
  const deletePromises = selectedPosts.map(id => postsAPI.deletePost(id));
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(deletePromises);
  // Handle results...
};
```

#### Select All Toggle
```typescript
const handleSelectAll = () => {
  if (selectedPosts.length === filteredPosts.length) {
    setSelectedPosts([]); // Deselect all
  } else {
    setSelectedPosts(filteredPosts.map(p => p.id)); // Select all
  }
};
```

#### Individual Selection
```typescript
const handleSelectPost = (id: number) => {
  setSelectedPosts(prev =>
    prev.includes(id)
      ? prev.filter(postId => postId !== id) // Remove
      : [...prev, id] // Add
  );
};
```
