[Return to login page]

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Can't access admin panel"
**Solution**: Make sure backend is running on port 8000
```bash
cd "c:/Users/NidaUllah/OneDrive - Higher Education Commission/Documents/Development/fb_marketplace_bot"
python manage.py runserver
```

### Issue: "Frontend not loading"
**Solution**: Make sure frontend is running on port 3000
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "All users showing as approved"
**Solution**: New users created with `is_approved=False` by default. Old admin is approved automatically.

### Issue: "User can't login even after approval"
**Solution**: 
1. Check in admin panel if "Is approved" is checked
2. Clear browser localStorage
3. Try login again
