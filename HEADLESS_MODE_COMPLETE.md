# ✅ HEADLESS MODE IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## 🎯 What Was Done

Successfully implemented **headless browser mode** for production deployment while keeping the browser visible during local development.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Settings Configuration** (`bot_core/settings.py`)
Added environment-based headless mode setting:
```python
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS = os.getenv('PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS', 'true').lower() == 'true'
```
**Default**: `true` (headless/production mode)

### 2. **Playwright Script** (`automation/post_to_facebook.py`)
- Added `get_headless_mode()` helper function
- Updated all 3 browser launch calls:
  - `save_session()`
  - `auto_login_and_save_session()`
  - `login_and_post()`
- Added mode indicator: `🌐 Browser mode: Headless/Visible`

### 3. **API View** (`postings/api_views.py`)
- Updated subprocess creation flags
- Console window only opens in development mode (Windows)
- Production: no console window, runs silently

### 4. **Documentation**
- Created `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- Created `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- Updated with troubleshooting and best practices

## 🚀 How To Use

### For Local Development (See Browser)
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false" > .env

# Run server
python manage.py runserver

# Browser will open when you post
```

### For Production/Hosting (Headless)
```bash
# Set environment variable
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true

# Or add to your hosting platform's environment variables
# The browser will run in background (no window)
```

### No Configuration (Default)
If you don't set `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS`, it defaults to `true` (headless mode).
